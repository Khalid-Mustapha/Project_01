4. Create a PHP script to retrieve the images and other text from the database and display them using separate layouts on a different page.

////////////

Use a link so that you may take the images to a new page ( phone.php) .

Then when you get the page , the respective details will be displayed ( look at a phone info website such as the specs website so that you may get several info from them).  

The pictures will be displayed in a grid format and the details will probably be in different sections.

You may make use of php layouts and fetch the details from the database and then use the fetch assoc to display everything all at once.


Try to use the css directly and use header with the a maybe you'll be able to command it directly before the header works


//////////
To display:
    echo "id: " . $innerarray["id"] . "\n";
    echo "image1: " . $innerarray["image1"] . "\n";
    echo "image2: " . $innerarray["image2"] . "\n";
    echo "phone: " . $innerarray["phone"] . "\n";
    echo "storage: " . $innerarray["storage"] . "\n";
    echo "ram: " . $innerarray["ram"] . "\n";
    echo "android_version: " . $innerarray["android_version"] . "\n";
    echo "back_camera: " . $innerarray["back_camera"] . "\n";
    echo "front_camera: " . $innerarray["front_camera"] . "\n";
    echo "price: " . $innerarray["price"] . "\n";
